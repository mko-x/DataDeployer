Simple OSX Cocoa FTP Client/Publisher
=================
What it does
-----------
Offers multiple file selection, creates an incrementing zip file and transfers it to a ftp folder. Stores user data in OSX key chain. Shows progress in a status process window.
Architecture
-----------
Stick to MVC with experimental raw DI via provider and delegates, use of protocols and categories. Several improvements possible as usual (e.g. SoC, SRP)
